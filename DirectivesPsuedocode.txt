       START
save start adrress
operand must be abs. address

       END   label
save end address, and calculate the length of the program , End the program
operand May be the label under the START directive

LABEL  RESW  n
LCCTR += 3*n , and label is to be added to SYMTAB
n must be dicimal integer

LABEL  RESB  n
LCCTR += 1*n , and label is to be added to SYMTAB
n must be dicimal integer

LABEL  BYTE  C'ab' || X'F1'
LCCTR += c >> no chars || x > (no chars / 2)   ,   and label is to be added to SYMTAB
c'ASCCI' || x'HEXA'
 
label WORD  n || X'012FA0'
LCCTR += 3 , and label is to be added to SYMTAB
n must be dicimal integer || x'HEXA'


NOTES
all Directive which access SYMTABhas to check wether the label is prediefined before defining it, if so it has to throw an error


QUESTIONS
- how to implement the SYMTAB
- how to throw an error
- how to check the format of the operand
- how to increment the LCCTR
